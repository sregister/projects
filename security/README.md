This project consisted of two different parts.

First for the first part we were given a SHA1 hash and were to find an input
in which the first two bytes would collide with the hash. This was an exercise
in getting familiar with the c openssl libraries. 

Second, we were given plaintext, ciphertext and the encryption algorithm used to 
produce the ciphertext and were tasked with finding the key. We were told that
the key was 16 characters long and if the word was shorter the reaming characters
would all be spaces. This again was practice using openssl libraries and learning
about bruteforcing.
